recorded jesus it tells me it's being recorded with an automated voice yes that's the way it goes isn't it all right so um first question i'm gonna start with some demographic information um just starting with how old are you currently i'm 22 okay

and what is your race i am white or caucasian of european descent

all right i don't know why i'm typing this out i have bi it's recording let's take take one note take one note want or need are you currently in a relationship of the romantic nature no unfortunately

unfortunately okay what is your sexual orientation i am straight or heterosexual

and what is your gender identity i identify as a male he him

cool all right so i'm trying to figure out the orientation of this screen okay all right

so first question oh i also wanted to let you know that um if any of these questions uh you don't feel like answering um let me know and we can skip or

i can i get like a brief like preface of just like what we are going to be talking about just to make sure sure we're just going to be talking about like your experiences with masculinity and being a man okay is that okay with you that's fine i just wanted to make sure i knew what the questions were about of course so we're just going to start with a little bit about your early development um and like your socialization if that's okay

okay in terms of like childhood yeah okay if you if you remember when was the first time you remember being aware of your gender

i don't think there's a specific met right i just feel like in preschool at some point

we were separated like the boys and the girls

and i was like oh i'm a boy so i was like oh i'm a boy okay so that was a big that happened a lot um especially in elementary school there would be a lot of like girls versus boys kind of like dodgeball kind of things so i mean like that definitely happened like elementary school i'd say as early as as early as preschool though i'd say there was at least a concept of it because the language of boy and girl was being used i was like oh i'm a boy

okay so

excuse me um your gender experiences were uh it was identified for you um

like first time you remember being cognizant of that was in preschool i think so okay

um and then during that time were there certain experiences you went through that taught you how you were supposed to act think or feel as a boy

um and then during that time were there certain experiences you went through that taught you how you were supposed to act certain experiences that would bias me towards certain behaviors based off of the assumption of my own gender yes like i mentioned you did like um you're saying oh i'm a boy and you made like the fists um

even still person at a very young age yeah i think this side of the spectrum is 차 another boy called me gay and i knew even at the time i didn't know what it meant necessarily but i could tell that it was derogatory in some way i could tell that it was

meant to be like a deviation from some norm if that makes sense so i think does that make sense does that answer the question that does make sense yeah um okay that answered the question really well um and did that send you any messages about how you were supposed to act as a man like it made me at the time at least it made me confused because my literal response to him at the time was like doesn't k just mean happy because i was thinking there was

some christmas song so i was like i don't know what this means um

in terms of how it shaped me i don't know that was so long ago i don't know exactly how it

zeroed in on anything in particular um

is there a way to rephrase the question

um um

yeah so like i guess

when you were called gay and how did you recognize that it was a bad thing or um what was the context in which they called you that and like i don't fully remember the context i just remember the tone of their voice was uh it was mocking it was very obvious and like faged into likeом was g-written in a way like it was you could definitely tell that it was meant to be an insult of some kind right um i don't know exactly what i was doing i assume it was something like

feminine in some way i don't know exactly what i think

i mean i had more friends that were girls as a kid that might have been it

i have no idea who were girls yeah that could have been it because i recognize that there was also like there's a group of boys i always hung out they always played like jackpot at recess and i would join them sometimes i had some people that i would join over there but i was more i had more fun uh either playing if i could i would love playing four square it's taking people it's great

um or

like there was a big map of the united states we would play states tag so you'd like save spots and everything's great

um so i don't think i would participate in the same activities as like

the the gaggle of boys so to speak so i think i don't know if that prompted it if there's something i don't know

yeah what about a little later on like middle school getting into puberty and such did you have any kind of like any more experiences like that or experiences that made you call into question how to express your masculinity

i mean gym class was always weird because i was like

i feel like it was a common answer uh but like

i'm like getting undressed in front of people that i've been like i'm like this kid in math class he's not a scholar student i don't like him that much and i'm just like

being vulnerable in front of them

i don't think that wasn't enjoy i didn't enjoy that very much it felt like

i don't know i felt like you had to like

swear to the seven you've kind of like hid yourself from other people like you didn't stare at anyone who's like looked into your locker you're pulling your clothes and they were like all right and it walked out depending if you could because like you kinda was booked in them for a while and everybody just kind of walked out wearing your clothes and they're like all right what's that about better than to carefully wear a mask until you need to wrap up the leaves on the side a few days later and stuff doesn't happen you've kind of At least that's what I did, because I was like, I don't want to look anyone in the eye, I don't want to start anything, I don't want to have any conversations this year, we're getting dressed, we're going outside. No interactions.

Okay, you didn't engage in any interactions?

No, I think because I was, in some way, I think I might have been scared of what would happen if I did. So I was like, would I be bullied in some way for, I don't know, my body, or would I be accused of staring or something, I don't know, exactly.

So you thought maybe people would kind of think your body wasn't up to their standards or that people would look at you strange?

I think that tricks. I think that's about right, yeah.

I think that's about right.
